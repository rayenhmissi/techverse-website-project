        <h3 id="g1">the first generation of computer OS (before 1950s)</h3>
        <p>
            before 1950s,computers lacked operating systems due to their limited capabilities.
            Instead,they used machine language and assembly language to run 
            a specific program and they used paper cards and magnetic tapes for ddata storage.
            There is no debugging,no programming language and the program need the full hardwre 
            so all the componen work for one task and consumes a lot of power and time to excute this program.
            In the 1950s ,assemblers became more advanced and became a key 
            role of the advancement of computers and programming languages.
        </p>
        <h3 id="g2">what is the machine language ?</h3>
        <p>
           machines don't understand human language 
           because they are using binary number language 
           this binary digital number  called bit and it has 
           two values 1 to say that the instruction work and 
           0 to say that it doesn't work.thanks to mathematic
           programmers make a translator to understand this bit
           language called compiler and to develop programs 
           easier .the rise of compiler and programming languages is a 
           game changer for technology and this allow for more capabalitie
           to do more complex tasks
        </p>
        <h3 id="g3">the rise of operating systtems (1950s) :single tasks operating systems</h3>
        <p>GMOS is developed in 1950s and it uses batches to organise 
            tasks in the operating systems.the operating system is 
            efficiant and it was made for IBM computers.<br>
            tasks are grouped into one batch and the batch processing system 
            excute task by task.
        </p>
        <h3 id="g4">third generation (1960s):Multi programming</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike batches that excute single task in one time,
            multi programming allow to do many tasks at the same time.
            DEC PDP and MS DOS were introduced betwenn 1960s and 1980s.
        </p>
        <h3 id="g5" >GUI operating systems (1980s to now):</h3>
        <p>
            with the introduction of machintoch and personal computing 
            in 1980s,computers become more ppular specially with the rise
            of Windows operating system by microsoft.useers can do many tasks
            with a click in the mouse instead of writing commands with the keyboard.<br>

            and still to these days ,graphical user interface operating systems became a part of 
            every machine even cellphones with the rise of Android and IOS.<br>
