        <h3>introduction</h3>
        <p>
            previously,OS is developed in a single block of code.MS DOS is 
            one of them.but this was a problem for developers in terms of
            testing and debuging and this make the OS less modular but in 
            modern OS,the structure become easier to understand and more efficiant.
            let's take a look of the structure of linux as an example for this lesson.
        </p>

        </div>
        <ol>
            <li id="l1" class="li">kernel</li>
            <p>
                the kernel is the core of linux,it is responsible for 
                process management ,memory management,communication between 
                hardware and software and file management.linux is a monolithic OS that allocate 
                all the resources needed in a single bloc of code .
            </p>
            <li id="l2" class="li">system libraries</li>
            <p>
                system libraries are prebuilt functions 
                to allow developers make apps easier 
                and optimise them and allow them to interact 
                with the kernel to run them efficiantly.GNU C library 
                is one of these libraries.
            </p>
            <li id="l3" class="li">shells</li>
            <p>
                shells are essential to use linux.
                it allows you writing command to exvute some 
                tasks like file management.bash is one of these 
                shells to write commands in linux.
            </p>
            <li id="l4" class="li">hardware layer</li>
            <p>
                hardware layer contain all the hardware components to let the 
                computer run well and the kernel  can access them and manage their 
                performance.
            </p>
            <li id="l5" class="li">user applications</li>
            <p>
                this contains all the applications that users need 
                for daily tasks like a web browser or a notepad.
            </p>
            <li id="l6" class="li">utilities</li>
            <p>these utilities are responsible for system settings like network settings,file management....
