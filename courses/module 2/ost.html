        <p>
            in 1984 ,apple introduced machintoch with its own 
            operrating system which was revolutionnary but it was
            very expensive .in 1985 microsoft releases windows to 
            compete with apple and windows and macOS still envolving
            to these days with macOS with apple silicon which revolutionise
            apple mac computers and windows with its versatility.

        <h3 id="t3">open source OS</h3>
        <p>
            windows is a licensed OS that need an activation key to buy even it is free.
            macOS is only for apple computers and IOS is for iphones .but there is another 
            type which is open source OS .linux is an open source OS that was made by 
            Linus Torvalds in 1991 by making the licensed OS Unix free to access without any 
            activation key like windows .this become possible when he accessed the full source 
            code and modify it and translate to c programming language .making linux open <source>
            allow many developers to join linux communitiy.
            Android is also open source made by android inc which was awuired by google to make 
            their phone OS as we know it today and google allow many companies to build on top of it like 
            samsung with OneUI and xiaomi with MIUI (now HyperOS) and oppo with ColorOS. but google still 
            have the control in terms of the kernel and the stock android version which is only  google can 
            modify it.
