        <h3>introduction</h3>
        <p>
            sometimes you  need to repeat operations like counting 
            and calculations like sum of sequential numbers.it is 
            a bad idea to write the same code many times.so we use something 
            called loops to repeat code with parametre changes.let's discover 
            them.

                <li class="li" id="l1">for loop</li>
                <p>
                    for loop has a starting point and a finishing point 
                    for example from 1 to 10 so it repeats the operation 
                    until passing the finishing point.here an example:
                    let's calculate the sum from 1 to 10 .so we have the counter c from 
                    1 to 10 and we initialise the s variable from 0.
                    here is the code :<br>
                    <code>
                        int s=0;//initialising s <br>
                        for (int c=0;c <= 10;c++){
                            //c counter begins from 0 and add 1 to its value every iteration<br>
                            s=s+c;//adding c to the sum <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p><br>
                <li class="li" id="l2">while loop</li>
                <p>
                    while loop means while the condition is true it repeats the operation until 
                    the condition become false.here an example:<br>
                    <code>
                        int c=0; //initialising the counter <br>
                        int s=0; //initialising the sum s<br>
                        while (c < 10){ //while c does not pass the condition<br>
                            s+=c; //add c to the sum s<br>
                            c++;//add 1 step to the counter <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p><br>
                <li class="li" id="l3">do while loop</li>
                <p>
                    do while loop is the same as while loop but with syntax differences.
                    it means do the operation while the condition is true.here an example:<br>
                    <code>
                        int c=0,s=0;//initialising s sum and c counter <br>
                        do{
                            s+=c;//add the counter to the sum <br>
                            c++;//add 1 step to the counter <br>
                        }while (c < 10);//while c does not pass 10
                    </code>
