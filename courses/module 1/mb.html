                    The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a port used to share data between devices and connect external peripherals such as 
                    keyboards, mice, and printers. It has several variants, including USB-A, which is commonly used for PCs and laptops, 
                    USB-C for modern devices, and smaller variants like Micro USB and Mini USB.
                    USB technology has evolved through different versions, with USB 3.2 being the latest version, offering very fast data transfer 
                    speeds. Another port, called Thunderbolt, was invented by Intel and provides even faster data transfer speeds than USB-C.

                <p>
                    The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a port that allows you to connect multimedia devices such as TVs, 
                    projectors, and gaming consoles like PlayStation and Xbox. It has several variants, including HDMI Standard, HDMI Type-C,
                    and HDMI Type-D, which are smaller versions. HDMI also comes in different versions to support various resolutions, up to 8K.

                    there are other i/o tools like sd-card reader and network port to connect
                    the device to the network and there is also a wifi card to access the wifi.

            <p>Every electric devices has integrated circuits that has many components to provide the power needed to run the device and this power is 
                coming from the power supply.

            <li id="l3" class="li">cooling:</li>
            <p>the cooling depends of the type of the device ,the ammount of power used and its form factor.
