        <p>
            we discover in the previous lessons each component of the computer 
            and now we see how to choose the <strong>best</strong> hardware for you.
            <b>remember that high end may be overkilled or too expensive for you so 
            you need to know what is the best computer for your needs and budget.

                the most important thing to buy anything is knowing what you 
                need and how much money you have or how much you can pay for 
                a computer.don't spend on a high end if you don't need it.
            </p>
            <li class="li" id="s2">laptop or desktop</li>
            <p>
                desktops are still have more advantages like better hardware ,
                better cooling and they are upgradable but they have cons like 
                they are not portable ,complicated for non tech geeks consumes 
                much power.so laptops are portable and you can use it anywhere
                all in one package without buying every components and consumes less 
                power but they have limited performance on battery and more heat .
                so if you prefer the maximum performannce and use computer only at home,
                choose a desktop .if you prefer portability and mobility and don't need 
                the full power of the machine,you should go for a laptop.
            </p>
            <li class="li" id="s">other considerations</li>
            <p>
                you should look at online reviews and don't rely on specs on paper.
                you should also don't buy older high end hardware rather than modern
                one if it is unsupported for softwares that you need because they are 
                not secure and have more heat and dead battery if it is a laptop.they are 
                also expensive if they are not available.so you need to be careful .old high 
                end hardware is not always powerful.it is only powerful for its generation
                and mid range modern hardware have competitive results and supported by OEMs.
                for example,in 2024 ,a midrange cpu can be better than high end cpu from 2021.

            <ol type="a">
                <li class="li" id="s3">school</li>
                <p>for schools you don't need the highest end hardware at all .
                    if you want desktop mid range components like intel core i5 is
                    sufficient but if you study computer science ,you need at least
                    16gb ram and 512gb and if you don't play demanding games in break time 
                    integrated gpu or low end dedicated are enough.if you study anything related to
                    3d you need dedicated gpu like nvidia rtx gpus and more ram and storage.in laptop side,you can afford 
                    a laptop with same requirements as a desktop but you should consider 
                    the weight,size,fan noise,heat and battery life.because you don't want to disturb your classmate 
                    with fan noise and high tempetures and don''t want your laptop to turn off before completing the 
                    the course ,specs on paper don't tell you these aspects.
                </p>
                <li class="li" id="s4">business</li>
                <p>for a business office like working in a bank or anything related you can consider a mide range desktop or thin and light laptop 
                    with 16gb ram recommanded because web browwsers need a decent amount of ram these days.you need an ssd drive for fast boot time 
                    and quick app launch.you need a laptop with decent battery life and minimal fan noise and heat with modern design.you don't need 
                    a dedicated gpu.
                </p>
                <li class="li" id="s5">software developers</li>
                <p>choosing a laptop for software developement depends on what you develop 
                    .if you are a web developer you need to focus on ram because web browwsers
                    needs a lot of ram at least 16gb.mid range cpu is enough and you don't a powerful gpu<br>
                    if you are apple developer who develops apps for apple products like iphone 
                    you need a mac especially macs with apple silicon but you should also begin from 16gb with 512gb ssd 
                    and macbook air is not the best for heavy workloads.<br>if you are windows app developer you can go 
                    with 16gb and i7 or ryzen 7 cpus.you don't need a high end gpu.<br>
                    if you are an android developer you need 16gb ram and a decent mid range cpu like i5 or i7 or ryzen 5 
                    or ryzen 7.<br>
                    if you are a game developer you need a powerful gpu like nvidia rtx or amd alternative like rx gpu,32gb ram ,ssd drive and 
                    a powerful cpu.<br>
                    if you are ai developer you need a powerful gpu or an npu and a powerful cpu and a lot of ram at least 32gbb ram.
                </p>
                <li class="li" id="s6"></li>
                <p>
                    if you are a designer you need a powerful cpu like i7 or ryzen 7 and gpu like rtx 40 series or rx 70series  with a 
                    decent amount of ram at least 32gb and you need a color accurate display
                </p>
                <li class="li" id="s7"></li>
                <p>
                    if you play competitive games that rely on fps you need a powerful cpu and gpu.you 
                    need to check the games performance and fps that you want to play on the hardware 
                    where you want to try these games because it depends on game optimisation.
                    gaming laptops have decent performance but you should not play on battery because 
                    you won't get the full performance but you should be careful on battery health of 
                    the laptop.
