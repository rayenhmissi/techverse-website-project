        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>a display has many panel types and characteristics like resolution ,ppi etc...so let's dive into them.</p>

        <h3 id="i0">what is a pixel</h3>
        <p>
            A pixel is a small square in the display that has three values (red ,green,blue or rgb for short).
            it can be single transistor 
        </p>
        <h3 id="i1">display panel types</h3>
        <h4>CRT (Cathode Ray Tube)</h4>
        <p>
            CRTs were commonly used in older computers and TVs.
            They utilize an electron beam to display pixels.
            CRTs are known for their fast response time, low cost,
            and high brightness. However, their main drawback is 
            the risk of burn-in when a static image is displayed
             for an extended period.
        </p>
        <h4>LCD and TN</h4>
        <p>
            liquid crystal display are used in modern devices and they are using a white backlight that why colors are very bright 
            and twisted nemantic (tn) are featuring a high refresh rate 
            and low latency but they cannot reproduce accurate colors.
        </p>
        <h4>TFT and IPS</h4>
        <p>thin film transistor (TFT) is using  a single transistor for each pixel.
            in plan switching (IPS) are using two transistor.here is a full comparison.
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>IPS</th>
                    <th>TFT</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>slower response</td>
                    <td>lower latency</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>realistic colors</td>
                    <td>low color accuracy</td>
                </tr>
            </table>    
        </p>
        <h4>LED (light emmiting diod)</h4>
        <p>
            LEDs use diodes instead of transistors, allowing them to produce a wider range of colors.
            However, LEDs can have brightness issues on larger screens, particularly OLEDs, which use 
            organic components. Mini LEDs do not have this problem because they use a large number of LEDs.
        </p>
        <h3 id="i2">resolution</h3>
        <p>
            resolution is the number of the pixels in the display.
            it is the multiplication of width of the display and 
            its height.<br>
            Here are standard values for resolution:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>HD (high definition):720x1280</li>
                <li>FHD (full high definition):1080x1920</li>
                <li>QHD or 2K (quad high definition):1440x2560</li>
                <li>4k (4000 pixels for width):3840 Ã— 2160 </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="i3">PPI</h3>
        <p>
            ppi is the number of pixel per inch.
        </p>
        <h3 id="i4">frame rate and refresh rate:</h3>
        <p>
            Frame rate refers to the number of images displayed on the screen per second. 
            For example, 30 FPS (frames per second) means 30 image frames are shown each second.
            Refresh rate, on the other hand, is the frequency at which the display updates with new
            images, measured in Hertz (Hz). For instance, a 120 Hz display refreshes 120 times per second.
            A low refresh rate can cause stuttering.
