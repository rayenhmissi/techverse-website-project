            previously,AI tasks are handled by the gpu with
            specific cores made for ML and AI.but in the last 
            yeears tech companies innovate a chip that can handle 
            these tasks and let the gpu to focus on its specific tasks 
            like graaphiics handling.in this lesson,we discover the basics 
            of AI and machine learning .let's dive right into it.

        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that simulates 
            human intelligence to perform complex tasks, such as intricate calculations.

        <p>
            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) 
            that enables machines to utilize AI tools, 
            such as computer vision for object recognition
            and audio recognition for identifying audio files to adapt and lerarn 
            without a need of programming.

        <li class="li"><h3 id="sl">what is supervised and unsupervised learning</h4></li>
        <p>
            supervised learning is a way that allow machine to learn 
            from user input and label it and generate an output while
            unsupervised leaning is way that allow machine learn with 
            unlabled data like images and audio files
        </p>
        <li class="li"><h4 id="dl">deep learning</h4></li> 
        <p>
            Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks 
            to perform complex tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
