    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>
        in the previous lesson ,we leaarn about the cpu 
        and today let's discover the gpu .let's dive in.

        <li class="li"><h4 id="gd">gpu definition</h4></li>
        <p>gpu (graphical processing unit) is a processing unit that is spesialised in the graphic related tasks like 3d ,animation and gaming. </p><br>

            <li class="li"><h4 id="geu">gpu excution units</h4></li>
            <p>as the cpu ,the gpu also has cores called excution units that to handle 
                tasks that the gpu can handle like graphics,3d,photos and animation and AI and ML tasks
                but gpus are very power hungry that why NPU (neural processing unit) exists to handdle AI tasks
                and allow the gpu to focus on more important tasks.we talk more about NPU in the next lesson.
            </p>
            <li class="li"><h4 id="gsh">gpu shaders</h4></li>
            <p>
            Shaders are responsible for instructing the execution units on how to process and render graphics. 
            They utilize shading languages, which vary depending on the graphics API being used.
            </p>
            <li class="li"><h4 id="ga">gpu API</h4></li>
            <p>
                Graphics APIs enable developers to utilize
                libraries and tools for creating applications 
                that rely on advanced graphics or high-quality games.
                Popular examples include Metal, DirectX, and Vulkan.
            </p>
            <li class="li"><h4 id="rt">ray tracing technology</h4></li>
            <p>
                Ray tracing is a technology utilized in modern GPUs, 
                such as NVIDIA’s RTX series. It enables the simulation of
                light tracing objects to create realistic reflections and dynamic
                 lighting effects,resulting in stunning visual quality.
            </p>
            <li class="li"><h4 id="up">upscaling</h4></li>
            <p>
                upscaling is a way to increase the resolution and the framerate
                that we will talk about the display lesson but now you should know that 
                what is upscalling .NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR and apple metal fx upscaling 
                are using this technology in their GPUs to improve performance.
            </p>
            <li class="li"><h4 id="tf">flops</h4></li>
            <p>
                Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS) is a unit used to measure the
                computational power of a GPU, indicating how many floating-point operations it 
                can handle per second. To calculate it, you multiply the GPU’s clock speed by 
                the number of floating-point operations per cycle and the number of shader cores.
                The formula is: Clock Speed×FLOPs per Cycle×Shader Coun.
