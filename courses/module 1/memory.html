        <p>A processor needs a memory to store data.here are the types of memory that we will discover :</p>
        <div class="d">

                <li class="l"><a href="#hdd">hard disk drive</a></li>
                <li class="l"><a href="#ssd">solid state drive</a></li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
    </div>
        <ol>
            <li id="ram" class="li">Random Access Memory (RAM):</li>
            <p>
            RAM is designed to access tasks randomly. It is significantly faster than SSD and HDD drives but 
            typically comes in smaller sizes and at a higher cost. Here’s how it works:<br>
            Imagine you are in a kitchen with many tools to make a cake. You place the tools you need on a table; 
            this table represents the RAM. It allows you to have multiple tools in one place for quick access. 
            If the table doesn’t have enough space, you need to save the other tools in their original place or
            store them together in another place called virtual memory, like a secondary table. The process of
            switching between these two types of memory is called swapping. When there is free space on the table,
            you take the tool you need from the secondary table and place it on the primary table.
                </p>

                <li id="rom" class="li">ROM (Read Only Memory):</li>
                <p>
                    This type of memory, known as Read-Only Memory (ROM), is used to read saved data even when 
                    the computer is turned off. It is primarily utilized in embedded devices and external peripherals 
                    that require read-only access to user input and cannot modify the stored data. ROM is also essential
                    in computers for booting the system and accessing the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) 12.
                </p>
                 <li id="reg" class="li">register</li>
                 <p>
                    registers are located in the cpu and they are the smallest types and the fastest .<br>
                    they saves temperory tiny data to process them faster .the size of register can vary betwenn 32 bit and 64 bit.
                 </p>
                <li id="cache" class="li">cache</li>
                <p>
                    cache is a data transfer tool between the cpu and the RAM.it is located on the cpu itself and save frequent data to
                    access and process them faster.    
            </p>
            <li id="rom" class="li">ROM (Read Only Memory):</li>
            <p>
                this type of memory is used to only read saved data even the computer is turned off.
                it is used mostly for embedded devices and external peripherals that read only user input and can't modify these data.
                rom are used in the computer to boot the system and access the bios (basic input output system).
            </p>
             <li id="reg" class="li">register</li>
             <p>
                Registers are located in the CPU and are the smallest and fastest types of 
                memory. They store temporary, tiny data to process it quickly. The size of 
                registers can vary between 32-bit and 64-bit.
             </p>
            <li id="cache" class="li">cache</li>
            <p>
                Cache is a data transfer tool between the CPU 
                and the RAM. It is located on the CPU itself and 
                stores frequently accessed data to process it faster.
            </p>
            <li class="li">storage drive</li><br>
            <ol type="a">
                <li id="hdd" class="li">Hard disk drive (HDD):</li>
                <p>
                    An HDD is composed of mechanical parts that spin when the computer 
                    is running. This is why its speed is measured in RPM (Revolutions Per Minute).
                    It is the slowest type of storage but also the most affordable. HDDs are commonly found
                    in older computers. The primary advantage of HDDs is their large storage capacity, allowing 
                    you to store a significant amount of data.
                </p>
                <li id="ssd" class="li">solid state drive (ssd):</li>
                <p>
                    Unlike HDDs, SSDs are much faster, and their speed ismeasured
                    in MB/s (Megabytes per second) or GB/s (Gigabytes per second) 
                    because they use electricity instead of mechanical components. SSDs are 
                    more expensive, which is why HDDs typically offer larger storage capacities
                    at the same price range. Here are the units of data measurement:
                </p>                
                <h4 class="li">bit:</h4>
                <p>
                bit (binary digit) and it has two only values 0 to say the process is running  and 1 to say the process is turned off.<br>
                the bit is the smallest unit to mesure data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 byte =8 bit</li>
                    <li>1 kilobyte (kB)=1024 byte</li>
                    <li>1 megabyte (MB)=1024 kB</li>
                    <li>1 gegabyte (GB)= 1024 MB</li>
                    <li>1 terabyte (TB) =1024 GB</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </ol>
